# Taxi 'Survival' Game README
v0.1 (Game version), 19.05.2020 (upload of this readme)

## Early development stage
This game is far from being finished and has many bugs, bad gamedesign decisions and missing features which will be fixed or added in the future

## Description
Taxi Survival Game is a game where the player drives a taxi from point to point to get a score. While the AI drives fast and aggressive through the streets to simulate a world of pure aggressive driving.

## Name of the Game
The name is a placeholder and might not be very appropriate considering the 'Survival'.
'Survival' stands for high, rapid and dangerous traffic that the player must survive in. Maybe 'Traffic' or 'Crash' or something else might be more appropriate, so the name could be changed in the future.

## Gameloop
The player drives to the green marker to pick up passengers and then to the blue destination. After that the player gets a score dependant on the distance between the green and the blue marker.
This loop continues until they crash into an AI.

## Input System
Currently (v0.1) there is only one input system: 'Axis Input'. Therefore the player can control the Taxi with WASD, but also with several types of controller.
This can be annoying if you have a controller connected which sends input but you want to use WASD instead. That is why this system will be changed in the future.
There will be two ways of input the player can choose: 'Axis Input' or 'Keycode Input'.
'Keycode Input' will lock the input to keys only (the player can choose which keys).
